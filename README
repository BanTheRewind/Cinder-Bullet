This block wraps the Bullet 3D physics engine for Cinder. 
It has a lot of features but there is a lot to go. The goal 
of this block is to provide an interface to Bullet without 
overly wrapping it.  The heavy lifting, such as world 
initialization, creating and managing VBOs to represent bodies, 
memory management, and interaction is done for you. From there, 
you just use Bullet directly.

BUGS

- Concave mesh body isn't scaling on Y axis
- Cylinder VBO normals are wrong
- Crash in exit

TO DO LIST

- Add Iter methods which take *Ref...
  Iter bullet::erase( const CollisionObjectRef &object ) { ... }
  Iter bullet::find( const CollisionObjectRef &object ) { ... }
- Screen -> dynamics world interaction
- Texture coordinates for VBOs (some are finished)
- Implement btConeShape
- Implement btStaticPlaneShape
- Soft body convenience methods
- Investigate if separate object is needed for bullets
- Static lib
- XCode static lib + samples
