This block wraps the Bullet 3D physics engine for Cinder. 
It has a lot of features but there is a lot to go. The goal 
of this block is to provide an interface to Bullet without 
overly wrapping it.  The heavy lifting, such as world 
initialization, creating and managing VBOs to represent bodies, 
memory management, and interaction is done for you. From there, 
you just use Bullet directly.

TO DO LIST

- Fix cylinder VBO normals
- Bug check terrain
- Screen -> dynamics world interaction
- Texture coordinates for VBOs
- Soft body convenience methods
- Static lib
- XCode static lib + samples
