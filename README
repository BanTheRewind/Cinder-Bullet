This block wraps the Bullet 3D physics engine for Cinder. 
It has a lot of features but there is a lot to go. The goal 
of this block is to provide an interface to Bullet without 
overly wrapping it.  The heavy lifting, such as world 
initialization, creating and managing VBOs to represent bodies, 
memory management, and interaction is done for you. From there, 
you just use Bullet directly.

TO DO LIST

- Change names:
  - "CollisionObjectBase" to "CollisionObjectRef"
  - "CollisionObject" to "CollisionObjectRef"
  - "SoftObject" to "SoftBody"
  - "RigidObject" to "RigidBody"
  - "BulletUtils.h" to "Utils.h"
- Move public utility methods into Bullet namespace 
  (Utilities class should be internal only)
- Use shared_ptr<T> create(...) instead of Singleton model
- Pass world into create methods. This...

  CollisionObjectRef bullet::create*( ... ) {
    return DynamicsWorld::getInstance->create*( ... );
  }

  ...should be...

  CollisionObjectRef bullet::create*( const DynamicsWorldRef &world, ... ) {
    return world->create*( ... );
  }

- Remove member vectors from CollisionObject. Pass vectors into setVboData method instead
- Remove clearVboData method from CollisionObject (not needed with above change)
- Add Iter methods which take *Ref...
  Iter bullet::erase( const CollisionObjectRef &object ) { ... }
  Iter bullet::find( const CollisionObjectRef &object ) { ... }
- Fix cylinder VBO normals
- Bug check terrain
- Screen -> dynamics world interaction
- Texture coordinates for VBOs
- Soft body convenience methods
- Vehicle convenience method
- Add "vehicle" pointer to collision object
- Add bullet::toBulletVehicle();
- Add CollisionObject::isVehicle();
- Investigate if separate object is needed for bullets.
- Static lib
- XCode static lib + samples
