This is a work in progress. It wraps the Bullet
3D physics engine for Cinder. It has a lot of features 
but there is a lot to go.

Some notable features include...

- VBO representations of all bodies
- Convenience methods for most rigid primitives
- Converts TriMesh into a convex or concave physics body
- Creates interactive terrain from heightfield (bitmap)
- Easy to use body manager
- Soft body dynamics ready
- Creates VBOs for all bodies for fast rendering

TO DO LIST

- Soft body dynamics to mirror rigid body convenience 
  methods
- Method for applying force to a collision object
- Mouse/screen to world method for interacting with objects
- Add params to sample project to control "brush"
- Code cleanup
- Static lib
- XCode static lib + samples
