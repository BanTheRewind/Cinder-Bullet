This block wraps the Bullet 3D physics engine for Cinder. 
It has a lot of features but there is a lot to go. The goal 
of this block is to provide an interface to Bullet without 
overly wrapping it.  The heavy lifting, such as world 
initialization, creating and managing VBOs to represent bodies, 
memory management, and interaction is done for you. From there, 
you just use Bullet directly.

BUGS

- Cylinder VBO is not aligned with its Bullet body on the Y axis
- Cone normals / tex coords needs to be fixed
- Concave mesh body isn't scaling on Y axis
- Crash on exit

TO DO LIST

- Add Iter methods which take *Ref...
  Iter bullet::erase( const CollisionObjectRef &object ) { ... }
  Iter bullet::find( const CollisionObjectRef &object ) { ... }
- Implement btStaticPlaneShape
- Soft body convenience methods
- Screen -> dynamics world interaction
- Investigate if separate object is needed for bullets
- Static lib
- XCode static lib
- Samples
  - Rigid primitive
  - Rigid mesh
  - Dynamic rigid mesh (camera terrain: how to extend an existing body)
  - GPU dynamic terrain (Bullet + GLSL: how to use a shader to update VBO)
  - Torus (how to create a custom body by extending CollisionObject)
  - Multisphere (how to implement Bullet shapes not supported by the block)
  - Soft body (interacts with rigid)
  - Soft body mesh from OBJ
  - Interaction / apply force
  - Ragdoll (springs, collision callback)
  - Multiple worlds
  - Vehicle
  - Bullets / fracture
