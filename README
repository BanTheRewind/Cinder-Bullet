NOTE: The block is undergoing heavy, new development in August. 
It may be in an unbuildable state while the repo is used
for backup during this time. A stable (read "buildable") beta is
expected on or by 2012-8-3.

DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK.  This repo is being used as a backup for
a work in progress.

This block wraps the Bullet 3D physics engine for Cinder. 
It has a lot of features but there is a lot to go. The goal 
of this block is to provide an interface to Bullet without 
overly wrapping it.  The heavy lifting, such as world 
initialization, creating and managing VBOs to represent bodies, 
memory management, and interaction is done for you. From there, 
you just use Bullet directly.

BUGS

- Cone tex coords needs to be fixed
- Concave mesh body isn't scaling on Y axis
- Crash on exit
